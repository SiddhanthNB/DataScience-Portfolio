# About Me
An ambitious Data Scientist, a programmer by passion, a progressive Electronics and Communication Engineer with an everlasting appetite to learn. Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siddhanth-nagendra-bhimakari/), [Github](https://github.com/SiddhanthNB).

Following are the repositories for my data science projects made for self learning, and hobby purposes.


# Contents
- ## Machine Learning
    - __Python:__
      - [CO2 Emission Prediction of LMVs](https://github.com/SiddhanthNB/LMV-Co2-Emission): Simple Linear Regression model used to predict CO2 emission and fuel consumption of light motor vehicles based upon various parameters like engine, transmission, cylinders etc.
  
      - [Abseenteism Prediction of Employees](https://github.com/SiddhanthNB/absenteeism-prediction): Fitting a Logistic Regression model to know for how many working hours an employee could be away from work in a business firm.
  
      - [Shop Customers Segmentation](https://github.com/SiddhanthNB/shop-customers-segmentation): Clustering analysis on a shop customers dataset using two main clustering algorithms (K-Means Clustering and Agglomerative Clustering) and comparing the results.
  
      - [Credit Card Anamoly](https://github.com/SiddhanthNB/credit-card-anamoly): Using credit card fraud detection dataset, built various classifictaion models and comapring the reults.
  
    - __R-Programming:__
      - [Start-Ups Profit prediction](https://github.com/SiddhanthNB/linear-regression-Rprogramming): Using startup's various spendings and marketing finances to predict which one will survive in the long run! (Model used is Linear regression)
  
      - [Finding Edibility of Mushrooms](https://github.com/SiddhanthNB/DecisionTree-classification-Rprogramming): Built a Decision Tree classifier model to classify various mushrooms between poisonous and edibile by analysing different attributes of the mushroom.

- ## Deep Learning and NLP:
    - __Deep Learning:__
      - [Image Classification using ANNs](https://github.com/SiddhanthNB/Fashion-MNIST): Using Tensorflow2.0 carried out the classification of various clothes images available as Fashion-MNIST dataset using shallow Neural Networks instead of much-preferred CNNs to classify images to check how well it performs in this case.
     
    - __NLP:__
      - [Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/SiddhanthNB/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis):  Sentiment Analysis of latest Tweets around a specific topic. 
        
        [Click here](https://tweet-sentiment-streamlit.herokuapp.com/) to find the data driven web-app built on this project.
      
- ## Data Visualization and EDA
     - [Covid-19 in India](https://github.com/SiddhanthNB/India-Covid19): Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization on statewise covid-19 cases in India. 
         
         Instead of loading a dataset, this project uses live and instantaneous data from web to perform further analysis. 
         
         [Click here](https://covid19-india-streamlit.herokuapp.com/) to visit the data driven web-app built on this project.

     - [Forest Fires in Brazil](https://github.com/SiddhanthNB/Brazil-forest-fire): Data visualization and Data analysis on forest fire incidents taken place in brazil between 1998-2017.
